## Description

Habit Tracker is a simple mobile app that allows you to keep track of daily habits, to do lists, or whatever else you want to track in your life.

Add new tasks to your list in the add task input at the bottom of your screen and check them off when they're complete.
Did you make a mistake? Long press any task in your list to remove it.
Is your list a daily recurring list? Check each task off as completed, and reset the list each morning when you're ready to start again.
